# Machine Learning: My First Neural Networks
Adapted from my workshop for the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics chapter of North Carolina State University in 2021.


Welcome to my second presentation on Machine Learning! We'll be going through three interactive Python notebooks in Google Colab, creating your first neural networks and introducing the foundations that can potentially lead to you using some of these techniques in your research in the future.

## Abstract:
Machine learning cool. How does it work? From LLMs to diffusion models, detecting drones to piloting them - the AI of today still uses the same basic building blocks, with a few new pieces. One of the most common and useful tools for these applications are neural networks: universal function approximators. This interactive workshop is meant for people with little or no machine learning experience, and is split into three parts: classification, convolutions, and autoencoders, and will cover all of the necessary mathematical background to get your first neural networks up and running. We will be using the popular MNIST dataset as a starting point for your own future research with machine learning tools.

No experience with AI is required, but it helps if you've used Python before, and a background in calculus and linear algebra is helpful, but not necessary. Hopefully this will give a peek behind the scenes the next time you run a language model or a YOLO.
